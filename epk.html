            <h3>Biographies</h3>
            <p style="margin-inline: 250px;">Here are two possible choices for a biography. One is for brief descriptions and the other is the band's full length biography.</p>
            <h4>Short Bio</h4>
            <p style="margin-inline: 250px;">Planet of the Little Green Men are a five-piece band based in New Orleans, Louisiana, initially formed in 2021 as a three-piece project for a university performance endeavor consisting of baby-faced, green little men.  Since their formation, the band have undergone various lineup changes, with the most recent in 2022, resulting in the recognizable five-piece band dynamic that listeners have come to know and love today.  Their sound has predominantly been described as psychedelic rock with roots in punk, garage, and jazz influences.  In the short time since their establishment, the band have proven to utilize a prolific and independent approach to the music industry, with an uncompromising, personalized, and distinctive ethos that funnels their creativity from the studio to the stage.  Since 2023, the band has released two full-length studio albums, “Count the Goblins” and “Hugs From Bugs” (with a collective > 10,000 streams), appeared on numerous radio shows including New Orleans’ own WWOZ, performed at notable festivals such as New Orleans’ Freret Street Festival in 2023 and French Quarter Festival in 2024, and undergone their first fully self-funded US tour in the spring of 2024.  The band is virtually never put on pause, writing and recording material, as well as planning their next tours and album releases in the time that they are not performing.  Planet of the Little Green Men is sure to leave a lasting impression upon listeners and concert goers alike, given their unique and energetic musical presence.  </p>

            <p style="margin-inline: 250px;">At the start of 2022, Victor Perez moved back to Puerto Rico and the band had to source a session player, Aidan Dokland, to temporarily fill in on bass.  After the group had been rehearsing together for some time, they thought it necessary to add a fifth member to the bunch - Jack Owen, the so-called “secret weapon” of the band.  To this day, Owen primarily functions as the tertiary (sometimes rhythm) guitar player who’s textural and psychedelic playing style elaborates upon and fills in the other player’s instrumentation with colorful and emotional layers that complete the musical picture of the group. With this five-piece lineup, the group performed at their first official concert as well as recorded their first single release “Arrival / Monster in Your Head”, released in January 2023, which has since garnered over 8,000 streams on Spotify and was described by OffBeat Magazine as “Psychedelic acid rock with Cake-esque talk-singing to aggressive punk shouting and speed without sacrificing the high-fidelity instrumentation much like British experimental rock band Black Midi.”  When Aidan Dokland had to step away from the band shortly after their first official concert performance, the group was yet again temporarily left without a bass player, but this did not stop them from continuing to write and record new material.  At the start of autumn 2022, Croft and Alvarez introduced Heil and Owen to Caleb Hedemark, the groups long-time running bass player and the final piece of the official lineup since his arrival.  With Hedemark’s budding bass skills flourishing within the band, the dust surrounding the group finally began to settle.</p>
            <p style="margin-inline: 250px;">Once the band had become comfortable with each other in their new and improved lineup, they consistently started to book and play more local shows as well as began to record their debut album “Count the Goblins” which they released in December 2023.  “Count The Goblins” consists of songs both written by Heil before the band’s genesis and songs conceived by the band as a whole. Its garage rock, psychedelic inspired tracklist serves as a monumental landmark for the band.  It wasn’t long after this current lineup came to fruition that the band began booking local festivals such as Freret Street Festival and French Quarter Festival in the heart of New Orleans, as well as many other local and DIY festivals and concerts.  The band has appeared on numerous radio stations in the New Orleans scene, including WWOZ, WTUL, and WHIV, furthering their reach in the local New Orleans community.  Alongside their heavy live performance schedule, in April of 2024 they released their sophomore full-length album “Hugs From Bugs” which leans further into the experimental, electronic, and psychedelic atmosphere that “Count the Goblins” scratched the surface of.</p>
            <p style="margin-inline: 250px;">Since the release of “Hugs From Bugs” the band has begun working on their acoustically inclined third record, as well as the many future releases to come after.  Despite their rigorous and proactive work schedule, the band made time to embark upon their very first US tour in the late spring of 2024.  “The Hugs From Bugs Tour” saw the band adventure further out into the country than ever before, playing shows in cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, and Atlanta, among others.  A documentary of the tour, a selection of live performances, as well as the band’s first music video can be found on their YouTube channel.  Today, the band continues to write, record, and plan their next move as they persist to push the boundaries of the industry that have been set before them.  Planet of the Little Green Men have proven to be an unstoppable force from a young age - one which has not yet even begun to peak and will continue to blossom as their career advances throughout the years. </p>
